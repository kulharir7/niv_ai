# 🧠 NIV AI — Developer Evolution Plan
## "From Tool User to Intelligent Architect"

**Current State:** v0.5.1 — Can create individual items (fields, scripts, DocTypes) via tools + RAG  
**Target State:** v1.0 — Can design, build, test, and deploy complete modules autonomously  
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks  

---

## 🎯 THE VISION

Imagine saying:
> "NBFC ke liye complete Loan Management System banao — Loan Application se lekar Recovery tak"

And Niv AI:
1. 📋 **Plans** — Shows blueprint: 12 DocTypes, 5 Workflows, 3 Reports, 8 Server Scripts
2. ✅ **Gets approval** — User reviews, modifies, approves
3. 🔨 **Builds** — Creates everything step by step, showing progress
4. 🧪 **Tests** — Verifies each component works
5. 🔧 **Fixes** — Auto-repairs any failures
6. 📊 **Reports** — "Module ready! 12/12 DocTypes, 5/5 Workflows. Test it here: /app/loan-application/new"

**That's the goal.**

---

## 📦 PHASE 1: Foundation Intelligence (Week 1-2)
### "Teaching the AI to understand Growth System deeply"

### 1.1 Growth System Relationship Graph
**What:** AI needs to know how DocTypes connect — which links to which, what creates what.

**Implementation:**
- New tool: `map_doctype_relationships` 
  - Input: DocType name
  - Output: All Link fields, Dynamic Links, child tables, naming series
  - Shows: "Sales Order → Sales Invoice (via Make button), Sales Order → Delivery Note"
- New knowledge chunk: `doctype_flow_map` — pre-built relationship data
  - Accounts: Quotation → Sales Order → Delivery Note → Sales Invoice → Payment Entry → Journal Entry
  - Stock: Purchase Order → Purchase Receipt → Stock Entry
  - HR: Job Applicant → Employee → Attendance → Salary Slip
  - Manufacturing: BOM → Work Order → Stock Entry
- Inject into dev system prompt so AI always knows the flow

**Why it matters:** Without this, AI creates orphan DocTypes that don't connect to anything.

### 1.2 Growth System Module Templates
**What:** Pre-built blueprints for common modules.

**Templates:**
```
📁 templates/
├── basic_crud.json          # Simple DocType with CRUD
├── master_detail.json       # Parent + Child table
├── approval_workflow.json   # DocType + Workflow + Notification
├── report_module.json       # Script Report + Chart
├── api_integration.json     # Custom DocType + Webhook + API
├── inventory_module.json    # Item-based tracking
└── industry/
    ├── nbfc_loan_module.json
    ├── ecommerce_order.json
    ├── crm_pipeline.json
    └── hr_recruitment.json
```

**Each template contains:**
- DocType definitions (fields, permissions, naming)
- Workflow definitions
- Server Scripts
- Client Scripts  
- Print Formats
- Report definitions
- Notification templates
- Dashboard configuration

### 1.3 Smart Field Suggestions
**What:** When creating a DocType, AI suggests relevant fields based on:
- DocType name/purpose
- Industry context
- Growth System conventions (naming_series, company, amended_from)
- Required fields (name, owner, creation, modified)

**Example:**
```
User: "Customer Registration DocType banao"
AI suggests:
- customer_name (Data, mandatory)
- customer_type (Select: Individual/Company)  
- mobile_no (Data)
- email_id (Data)
- pan_number (Data) — if NBFC context
- aadhaar_number (Data) — if NBFC context
- kyc_status (Select: Pending/Verified/Rejected)
- company (Link: Company)
- naming_series (Select)
```

---

## 📦 PHASE 2: Blueprint System (Week 2-3)
### "Plan before you build"

### 2.1 Blueprint Generator
**What:** AI creates a complete module plan before building anything.

**Flow:**
```
User: "Loan Management System banao"

Approve? (yes/no/modify)
```

### 2.2 Blueprint Storage
**What:** Save blueprints as JSON for reuse/sharing.

```python
# New DocType: Niv Blueprint
{
    "doctype": "Niv Blueprint",
    "fields": [
        {"fieldname": "blueprint_name", "fieldtype": "Data"},
        {"fieldname": "industry", "fieldtype": "Select", "options": "Generic\nNBFC\nE-commerce\nManufacturing\nHR"},
        {"fieldname": "blueprint_json", "fieldtype": "JSON"},
        {"fieldname": "status", "fieldtype": "Select", "options": "Draft\nApproved\nExecuted\nFailed"},
        {"fieldname": "execution_log", "fieldtype": "Long Text"},
        {"fieldname": "components_created", "fieldtype": "Int"},
        {"fieldname": "components_total", "fieldtype": "Int"},
    ]
}
```

### 2.3 Step-by-Step Executor
**What:** Execute blueprint step by step with progress updates.

```

## 📦 PHASE 3: Domain Intelligence (Week 3-4)
### "Industry-specific brain"

### 3.1 NBFC Domain Pack
**The killer feature for Growth System deployment.**

**Knowledge includes:**
```
📚 NBFC Knowledge Pack
├── Regulatory
│   ├── RBI guidelines for NBFC
│   ├── NPA classification rules (30/60/90 days)
│   ├── KYC requirements (CKYC, Video KYC)
│   ├── Interest rate caps
│   └── Fair Practices Code
│
├── Loan Lifecycle
│   ├── Lead → Application → Sanction → Disbursement
│   ├── EMI Schedule generation (flat/reducing balance)
│   ├── Prepayment/Foreclosure rules
│   ├── Bounce handling (NACH/ECS)
│   └── Recovery/Write-off process
│
├── Products
│   ├── Personal Loan
│   ├── Business Loan  
│   ├── Gold Loan
│   ├── Vehicle Loan
│   ├── Microfinance/Group Loan
│   └── Co-Lending (FLDG model)
│
├── Reports (RBI mandated)
│   ├── CRAR/Capital Adequacy
│   ├── ALM (Asset Liability Mismatch)
│   ├── NPA/Provisioning
│   ├── Sector-wise exposure
│   └── Interest rate sensitivity
│
└── Integrations
    ├── CIBIL/Equifax/Experian
    ├── eSign/eStamp
    ├── NACH/eMandate
    ├── Account Aggregator
    └── Penny Drop verification
```

**How it works:**
- When user says "NBFC" or context is Growth System → inject NBFC knowledge
- AI understands: "EMI schedule" means reducing balance calculation
- AI knows: NPA marking needs cron job checking overdue > 90 days
- AI suggests: "Aapko CIBIL integration bhi chahiye kya?"

### 3.2 Domain Pack Architecture
```python
# niv_ai/niv_core/knowledge/domains/
├── __init__.py
├── base_domain.py        # Abstract class
├── nbfc.py               # NBFC pack (15-20KB)
├── ecommerce.py          # E-commerce pack
├── manufacturing.py      # Manufacturing pack
├── healthcare.py         # Healthcare pack
└── education.py          # Education pack

# Each pack provides:
class NBFCDomainPack(BaseDomainPack):
    name = "NBFC/Lending"
    
    def get_system_prompt(self):
        """Domain-specific system prompt addition"""
        
    def get_blueprints(self):
        """Pre-built module blueprints"""
        
    def get_field_suggestions(self, doctype_name):
        """Smart field suggestions for this domain"""
        
    def get_workflow_templates(self):
        """Common workflows in this domain"""
        
    def get_validation_rules(self):
        """Business rules (NPA, interest calc, etc.)"""
```

### 3.3 Context-Aware Suggestions
**What:** AI proactively suggests related components.

```
User: "Loan Application DocType banao"

AI: "Loan Application ke saath ye bhi chahiye kya?
 📋 Loan Product (interest rates, tenure options)
 📋 Loan Sanction Letter (Print Format)  
 📋 Approval Workflow (Maker → Checker → Approver)
 📋 KYC Checklist (child table)
 📋 CIBIL Score fetch (Server Script)
 📋 Auto-reject low score (Workflow condition)
 
 Sab banau ya kuch specific?"
```

---

## 📦 PHASE 4: Self-Healing Builder (Week 4-5)
### "Build, Test, Fix — automatically"

### 4.1 Auto-Test After Creation
```python
# After creating any component, automatically verify:

class SelfTester:
    def test_doctype(self, doctype_name):
        """Create → Read → Update → Delete test record"""
        
    def test_workflow(self, workflow_name):
        """Create doc → move through all states"""
        
    def test_server_script(self, script_name):
        """Trigger the event → check if script runs"""
        
    def test_report(self, report_name):
        """Run report → check it returns data"""
        
    def test_print_format(self, format_name):
        """Generate PDF → check it's not empty"""
```

### 4.2 Error Diagnosis Engine
```
❌ Server Script failed: NameError: 'frappe' is not defined

AI diagnosis:
- Server Scripts have frappe auto-imported
- But this is a Client Script being saved as Server Script
- Fix: Change script type to "Client Script"
- Or: Remove client-side code (cur_frm, etc.)

Auto-fixing...
✅ Fixed: Changed to Client Script, removed 'frappe.' references, added 'cur_frm.'
```

### 4.3 Rollback on Failure
```
Building Loan Module... step 15/23 FAILED

AI: "Step 15 failed (Server Script syntax error). 
Options:
1. 🔧 Auto-fix and continue
2. ⏪ Rollback last 5 steps
3. ⏪ Rollback entire module
4. ⏭️ Skip this step and continue

Choose: "
```

---

## 📦 PHASE 5: Production Intelligence (Week 5-6)  
### "From development to deployment"

### 5.1 Migration Script Generator
**What:** After building a module in dev, generate migration scripts for production.

```python
# Auto-generates:
# 1. fixtures/ — all Custom DocTypes, Fields, Scripts as JSON
# 2. patches/ — Python migration scripts
# 3. hooks.py updates — doc_events, scheduler_events
# 4. requirements.txt — if any pip packages needed
# 5. README.md — module documentation
```

### 5.2 Deployment Assistant
```
AI: "Loan Module ready for deployment!

📦 Export Package:
├── loan_module_fixtures.json (8 DocTypes, 5 Workflows)
├── loan_module_scripts.json (5 Server Scripts, 3 Client Scripts)
├── loan_module_reports.json (4 Reports)
├── install_patch.py
└── README.md

Deploy to Growth System?
→ bench --site mdfc-test.growthsystem.in import-fixtures loan_module_fixtures.json

Or download as zip?"
```

### 5.3 Health Monitor
```
AI periodically checks:
- ❌ Server Script "NPA Marker" has 23 errors in last 24h
- ⚠️ Workflow "Loan Approval" — 5 documents stuck in "Pending" state
- ✅ Report "EMI Collection" — working fine, last run 2h ago
- ⚠️ DocType "Loan" — 3 custom fields have no data (unused?)
```

---

## 📦 PHASE 6: Multi-Agent & Collaboration (Week 7-8)
### "Team of AI specialists"

### 6.1 Specialist Agents
```
👨‍💻 Architect Agent — Plans module structure
👨‍🔧 Builder Agent — Creates DocTypes, fields, scripts  
🧪 Tester Agent — Tests everything created
📊 Analyst Agent — Generates reports and dashboards
🔒 Security Agent — Checks permissions, validates inputs
```

### 6.2 Collaborative Building
```
User: "Complete CRM banao"

Architect: "CRM module plan ready — 6 DocTypes, 3 Workflows, 2 Dashboards"
Builder: "Building Lead DocType... done. Building Opportunity... done."
Tester: "Testing Lead → Opportunity conversion... PASS"
Analyst: "Sales Pipeline dashboard created with 4 charts"
Security: "Added role permissions: Sales User, Sales Manager, Sales Admin"

All: "✅ CRM Module complete! 100% tests passing."
```
